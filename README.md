# K8SPurger

## A Simple script to hunt and delete unused Kubernetes resources such as Services, Secret, ConfigMap, and Persistent Volume Claim

### Update:- Added Services in the mix.

NAQ (Nobody asked Question).

1) What this script do?

A:- This will find all unused resources and show them in a nice format and optionally remove them.

2) Why you need this?

A:- This is not required. I was learning Python and according to my Moto "Fail Fast.. Learn Faster" I started this project as we have 15+ Kubernetes clusters and we have a lot of such unused resources because of kustamize configmap/secret and a lot of POC which come and go which pile up such resources.

3) Is this cause any effect on my cluster?

A:- By default script will run in Dry-Run mode which should only get the details of the resource. There is an optional --delete=true flag if you want to delete the unused resource but it is recommended that you should run as Dry-run first to avoid any impact to the cluster. 

Note:- You should not trust strangers' words on the internet so browse the script as it is under apache 2 License and try on dummy cluster.

4) How this work? Can I just use the kubectl command to do the same?

A:- The kubectl does not directly give these details you have to invest a lot of time. If you know a short way, Please let me know via raising the issue (sharing is caring). This script will get all pods in all namespaces and scan them for these resources and make a list and then get the resource in Kubernetes and just give you the difference.

5) So if I understood correctly it will scan the pod only. what if I have deployement/StatefullSet which has zero replica set?

A:- Yes, in that case, the resource will be shown as unused. That's why this script runs in dry-run mode by default so you can see and take action yourself. If you have zero replicas mean you are not using that resource.

6) Why PVC why not PV?

A:- Normally we use PVC to manage PV and when we delete claims, PV will be deleted or retained as per storage-class configuration. To avoid any potential data loss I choose to work with PVC only.

7) I see you have added service how that work?

A:- The logic is same if we have defined a service but it does not have any endpoint then I am marking as service unused as any traffice send to service result in error.

8) What if I hit a bug or required any feature?

A:- You can raise an issue. I will try to fix the bug. The feature has to look into how much time is required.

9) I did check the script your python code is awful?

A:- Yes. As I said I am learning any guidance is welcome. You can raise PR so I can understand how PRO writes the code and improve my code.



## Installation and Configuration

This script use [Python client for Kuberntes](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python). We need to install that first

```
pip install kubernetes
python K8sPurger.py
```

### By default, it will run in dry-run mode and just show you the unused resources such as.

```
yogesh$ python K8sPurger.py

This script is created to find unused  resource in Kubernetes and delete them

Extra Secrets are 3 which are as below
---------------------------
| Secrets       |Namespace |
---------------------------
| appsnewsecret |apps      |
| testsecret    |apps      |
| testsecret    |default   |
---------------------------
 

Extra ConfigMap are 4 which are as below
-------------------------
| ConfigMap   |Namespace |
-------------------------
| test        |apps      |
| testing     |apps      |
| test        |default   |
| thisisnewcm |default   |
-------------------------
 

Extra PV Claim are 1 which are as below
---------------------------
| PV Claim      |Namespace |
---------------------------
| task-pv-claim |default   |
---------------------------

Extra Services are 1 which are as below
--------------------------
| Services     |Namespace |
--------------------------
| icinga-agent |default   |
```
### If you are sure you can delete the resources by appending flag --delete=true

```
yogesh$ python K8sPurger.py --delete=true

This script is created to find an unused  resource in Kubernetes and delete them


Extra Secrets are 3 which are as below
---------------------------
| Secrets       |Namespace |
---------------------------
| appsnewsecret |apps      |
| testsecret    |apps      |
| testsecret    |default   |
---------------------------
 

Extra ConfigMap are 4 which are as below
-------------------------
| ConfigMap   |Namespace |
-------------------------
| test        |apps      |
| testing     |apps      |
| test        |default   |
| thisisnewcm |default   |
-------------------------
 

Extra PV Claim are 1 which are as below
---------------------------
| PV Claim      |Namespace |
---------------------------
| task-pv-claim |default   |
---------------------------

Extra Services are 1 which are as below
--------------------------
| Services     |Namespace |
--------------------------
| icinga-agent |default   |

You have selected to delete unused items which are as above you want to continue?
Type yes or y to continue or any key to exit.

```
###  You can say no even after passing --delete=true flag and script won't delete the resources.

```
yogesh$ python K8sPurger.py --delete=true

This script is created to find unused  resource in Kubernetes and delete them

Hurray You don't have a unused Secrets
 
Hurray You don't have a unused ConfigMap
 
Hurray You don't have a unused PV Claim

Hurray You don't have a unused Services

You have selected to delete unused items which are as above you want to continue?
Type yes or y to continue or any key to exit.
n
You choose not to auto delete. Great choice! You can clean them up manually.
```
